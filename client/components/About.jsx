        <ul>
          <li>
          Retune your Guitar often: Ideally the tuning should be checked every time before you play, especially before a performance. It is surprising how many things can affect the pitch of your strings; temperature changes/humidity around where your Guitar is stored, string lifespan, picking styles of play or bending/sliding on the fretboard can all lead the strings to loosen and their note output to alter.
          </li>
          <li>
          Replace your strings when needed: When you start to see wear on the strings or you can feel bumps or roughness when you run your finger along a string these are signs that a replacement is needed. If a string breaks it can be very dangerous (and sometimes painful). Also, never replace one string at a time, if one needs replacing just do the whole Guitar. If one has gone chances are the others are not far off.
          </li>
          <li>
          Do not Tune too fast: Any major changes in string tension too quickly can decrease the lifespan of the string and cause it to snap. If you have to tune the string up or down a long way, do it slowly.
          </li>
        </ul>
