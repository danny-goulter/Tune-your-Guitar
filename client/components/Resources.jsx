        <h4>By Ralph Denyer</h4>
        <p>
          This book is an absolute bible and a great book to buy if you are starting to learn the Guitar or a brilliant gift for someone you know who is. I have had my well-worn copy since I started learning in about 1990 and I still refer to it often. The full Chord Dictionary included in the back is particularly useful. Also included are robust instructions on caring for and maintaining your instrument, write-ups on legendary Guitarists, a well-researched history of the instrument, and so much more helpful content.
